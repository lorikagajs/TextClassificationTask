# Multi-Label Emotion Classification from Text

This project is a **multi-label text classification system** that predicts multiple emotions from raw text data. It includes **preprocessing, feature extraction, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and saving trained models**.  

The models used are:  
- **Logistic Regression** (wrapped in One-vs-Rest)  
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** (wrapped in One-vs-Rest)

## ðŸ“„ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is taken from the following paper:

> SemEval-2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection (Muhammad et al. 2025)

> Dataset link: https://brighter-dataset.github.io/

The dataset contains sentences labeled with multiple emotions:  
- `anger`  
- `fear`  
- `joy`
